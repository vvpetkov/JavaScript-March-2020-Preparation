Hi this is my feedback


01
sum-of-three-numbers.js


I prefer to have a number in file name like:
 01.sum-of-three-numbers.js
Homework Description in site  have a number of the problem followed by description: Problem 1. Sum of 3 Numbers


I do not understand some code before input ?
I do not understand why you parse 2 times string input to number?
first with Number() and inside +gets()
let secondNumber = Number(+gets());
you can do it with only one parse: 
let firstNumber = Number(gets());


02
print-company-information.js 


I do not understand some code before input ?


for fax number we do not have input 
so we need to make Solution for this problem, not to hard-code it to the input


03
circle-perimeter-and-area.js


I do not understand some code before input ?


After command Format Document: one small formatting

number-comparer.js

05 
quadratic-equation.js


I do not understand some code before input ?


It the results I expected to see : x1=-3; x2=0.5, but you give me: First root: x = -3 and Second root: x = 0.5 


in judge this will be wrong answer 
I do not understand why you parse 2 times string input to number?
first with Number() and inside +gets()
let b = Number(+gets()); 


06
sum-of-five-numbers.js

See you soon and have nice day

Hi this is my feedback




homework 1.js 


The program works, but:
You need to take value from the input array ( let input = []; ) and use gets();
input need to be string
if you working with numbers:
you need to parse to numbers:
 num1 = Number(num1);


Instead you initialize the input in the Solution 


homework2.js


After command Format Document: 
one small formatting in the input

homework3.js


After command Format Document: small formatting


The program works, but:

homework4.js


After command Format Document: small formatting


The program works, but:
Very short solution not descriptive one !
I like to put solution in variable with descriptive name and print it.


homework5.js


After command Format Document: one small formatting


The program works, but:


You need to take value from the input array ( let input = []; ) and use gets();
input need to be string
if you working with numbers:
you need to parse to numbers:
 num1 = Number(num1);


Instead you initialize the input in the Solution


It the results I expected to see : x1=4; x2=4, but you give only 4, 4 


homework6.js


After command Format Document: 
one small formatting in the input


I do not understand the solution, the result is OK 
You use more advance methods for solving the problem 
look like very elegant solution, nice work




homework7.js

07
You have no input!
That will give you WA!
In the first line you must put input 


The program is not give you max and MIN sum 
That will give you WA!


Resume
Only one program is wrong, but all programs will not pass, because of input








Have a nice day
