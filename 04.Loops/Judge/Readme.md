Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of **N** real numbers and returns the *minimal*, the *maximal* number, the *sum* and the *average* of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point).

- The input starts by the number **N** (alone in a line) followed by **N** lines, each holding an real number.
- The output is like in the examples below.

#### Input

- On the first line, you will receive the number **N**.
- On each of the next **N** lines, you will receive a single real number.

#### Output

- You output must always consist of *exactly* 4 lines - the minimal element on the first line, the maximal on the second, the sum on the third and the average on the fourth, in the following format:

Copy

```
min=3.00
max=6.00
sum=9.00
avg=4.50
```

#### Constraints

- 1 <= **N** <= 1000
- All numbers will be valid integer numbers that will be in the range `[-10000, 10000]`
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

#### Sample tests

| Input    | Output                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 3 2 5 1  | min=1.00 max=5.00 sum=8.00 avg=2.67  |
| 3 2 -1 4 | min=-1.00 max=4.00 sum=5.00 avg=1.67 |
