Homework Description
Problem 1. Compare arrays
Write a program that reads two number arrays of size N from a sample input and compares them element by element.



Input:
On the first line you will receive the number N
On the next N lines the numbers of the first array will be given
On the next N lines the numbers of the second array will be given


Output:
Print Equal if the two arrays are the same and Not equal if they are not



Examples:


Input          	Output
3
1
2
3
1
2
3	Equal
Input          	Output
3
2
4
6
6
4
2	Not equal



Problem 2. Compare Character Arrays Lexicographically
Write a program that compares two arrays of single-letter strings lexicographically (letter by letter). Research how to convert string to and array of single-letter strings.



Input:
On the first line you will receive the first array as string
On the second line you will receive the second array as string


Output:
Print First if the first array is lexicographically smaller
Print Second if the second array is lexicographically smaller
Print Equal if the arrays are equal


Examples:


Input          	Output
telerik
teleric	Second


Input          	Output
own
owned	First


Input          	Output
omg
omg	Equal



Problem 3. Maximum Sequence
Write a program that finds the length of the maximum sequence of equal elements in an array of integers.



Examples:


Input                              	Output
2 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 2 1	3



Problem 4. Is Array Sorted?
Write a program that determines if an array of numbers is sorted in increasing order.



Examples:


Input                                        	Output
1 2 4 8 12 34 200 2000	Yes
Input                                        	Output
7 8 9 10 11 12 11 13 9	No



Problem 5. Find Two Biggest Numbers
Write a program that finds the two biggest numbers from an array of numbers



Examples:


Input                                  	Output
8 2 1 3 5 8 9 11 2 5	11 9
Input                                  	Output
8 7 8 11 7 11 5 8 10	11 11



Problem 6. Is Array Symmetric
Write a program that finds if an array of numbers is symmetric - that is, the first number is equal to the last, the second - to the second last and so on



Examples:


Input                      	Output
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1	Yes
Input                      	Output
7 8 9 8 7	Yes
Input                      	Output
3 4 5 3 4 5	No



Problem 7. Is Array in Wave Form
Write a program that determines if an array of numbers is in Wave Form -
e.g. first > second < third > fourth < fifth > ...



Examples:


Input              	Output
2 1 2 1 2 1 2	Yes
Input              	Output
7 3 5 2 8 4	Yes
Input              	Output
2 1 3 4 2 3	No



Problem 8. Negative-Positive Sort
Write a program that moves all negative numbers to the beginning and all positive to the end, without changing the order of positive negative



Examples:


Input                                      	Output
7 2 -2 1 -5 4 5 -3 1	-2 -5 -3 7 2 1 4 5 1



Problem 9. Print Maximum Increasing Subsequence
Write a program that prints the maximum length increasing subsequence to the console. If two or more are of the same length, print the last one



Examples:


Input                                          	Output
6 7 3 8 1 9 4 5 6 2 1 3                  	4 5 6
Input                                          	Output
1 2 3 4 3 1 9 4 5 6 11                  	4 5 6 11



Problem 10. Repeating Numbers
Write a program that finds the repeating number. All other numbers occur only once.



Examples:


Input                            	Output
1 2 3 4 5 6 5 8 9	5



Problem 11. Pairs
Write a program that find all pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to a given number. On the first line you will receive the target sum, on the second line - the array.



Examples:
